 What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
    It is a UI library made of components to help manage sites in complex states. The components are reusable and versatile and helps reduce
    performance load of a website.



 What does it mean to think in react?
    To me, to think in react is to think about how you can break the website you want to build down into components to make it easier
    to build and control.


 Describe state.
    It's a Javascript object that basically 'watches' attributes etc and tells the components how to load in the DOM.


 Describe props.
    They are values of the state read as arguments that can be used in different components.
